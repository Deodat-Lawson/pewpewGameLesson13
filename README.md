# pewpewGameLesson13
This is all I have up to lesson 13, I have made slight changes to the original code. There is a bug where the bullets are stuck in one place and not disappearing, so I added a life duration for all the bullets.  I also nerfed the enemy's shooting speed and buffed the amount of enemies.
